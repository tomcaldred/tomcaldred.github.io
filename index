I'm here to upskill on data, as I'm 20 years in the GES and feeling quite rusty. I'm also road-testing this course as head of the GESR team, to see if we want to work with ECO to roll it out further!
My level of experience is rock bottom
What I'd like to learn is, in some sense, a better idea of what I don't know and what I might be able to do, or what others in my team might be able to do, with a little investment.
